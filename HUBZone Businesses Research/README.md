# Government Contracting Analysis: HUBZone & Small Business Set-Asides

## Overview
This project **analyzes federal contract awards** from **2019â€“2023** using **NAICS codes**, **set-aside types**, and **socio-economic business classifications** to identify trends in government contracting. It leverages **Pandas, SQLite (pandasql), and USAspending.gov data** to extract insights on:
- **HUBZone & Small Business awards** (nationally & regionally)
- **Top NAICS industries receiving contracts**
- **Businesses in Dodge County registered in SAM with contracts**
- **Federal agencies awarding HUBZone & Small Business contracts**
- **DSBS (Dynamic Small Business Search) business profiles**

## Data Sources
- **USAspending.gov**: Federal contract awards data (`FY19-FY23`)
- **SAM.gov & DSBS**: Business registration data
- **Local Government Data**: Fremont & Dodge County business profiles
- **NAICS Codes**: Industry classifications for contract awards

### 4. Agency-Level Analysis
- **Top 10 federal agencies** awarding:
  - HUBZone contracts (National & Regional)

- **Breakdown by socio-economic status**.

### 5. Data Processing Logic
- **SQL Queries (`pandasql`)** for:
