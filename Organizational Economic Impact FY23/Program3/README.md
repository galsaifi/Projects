## Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Address Handling**:
  - If all address fields are missing, **default county is set to Wayne**.
- **Client Grouping**:
  - Clients are **grouped by county**.
  - Missing values are handled appropriately.

### 2. Geographic Visualization
- **Mapped client counts** to county boundaries using `ggplot2` and `sf`.
- **Applied log-transformed color scaling** for better representation.

### 3. Industry Classification
- **NAICS Codes** mapped to industry categories:
  - Example categories: **Agriculture, Mining, Construction, Manufacturing, Retail, Transportation, etc.**
- **Businesses grouped by industry**, and **top industries identified**.

### 4. Congressional District Analysis
- **Client count breakdown by congressional district**.
